<h2>Standout players from todays game:</h2>
<h3>Position Player: Dixon Machado<h3>
<h4>Today Dixon Machado broke out with a 3 hit performance. His key hitting proved to be crucial to beat out the win against the Blue Jays. Machado has started of this spring fighting for a spot on the Tiges bench. While not know for being a standout hitter he continues to impress with his glove work this spring.<h4>

<h3>Pitcher: Michael Fulmer<h3>
<h4>Michael Fulmer continues to show us why he was the AL rookie of the year last year, with another solid outing today. He allowed 3 hits in 2 innings, while striking out 3 to keep the runs off the boards. He definitely sounds confident and ready to get the season started.<h4>

<h2>Off to a Rough Start:</h2>
<h3>Position Player: Justin Upton:</h3>
<h4>Justin Upton has always been known as a hot and cold hitter. He goes on tears for weeks and then will be non existent for a stretch. This spring he is off to a cold start. Hitting just .100 with no homeruns. Upton got off to the  slowest start of his career last year, hitting just 8 Home runs before the all-star break. But he tore the cover off the ball in the last 2 months of the season to tie his career high in home runs with 31. The tigers can't afford for Upton to get off to that slow of a start if they want to compete this year. It is still very early in the spring and for the tigers sake he will have turn things around soon.</h4>
<h3>When he's on we know what hes capable of.  Here's a quick reminder:</h3>

<h3>Pitcher: Shane Greene
<h4> The only thing remaining evidence of the doug fister trade. After a injury plagued first season and an underwhelming 2nd season, Shane Greene has come into camp looking to make an impact in the Bullpen. He showed signs of dominance last year at times and at other times he looked lost. So far this spring he has looked the later. He has given up 5 hits, including a Home Run in just 2 innings of work. He's currently sitting at an ERA of 13.50. Heres to hoping for improvement as the spring goes along.
<h3> Hopefully we see this Shane Greene show up soon</h3>
